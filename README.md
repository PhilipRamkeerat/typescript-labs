## Getting Started

To run these TypeScript exercises locally, you will need Node.js, TypeScript, and ts-node installed on your computer. Hereâ€™s a quick guide:

1. **Install Node.js**

   - You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install TypeScript and ts-node**

   - Once Node.js is installed, you can install TypeScript and ts-node by running:
     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript ts-node
     ```

3. **Running an Exercise**
   - Navigate to the repository's root directory and run the specific npm script for an exercise. For example, to run Exercise 1:
     ```bash
     npm run exercise1
     ```
