# Exercise 1

## Objective

Create a program to determine the resistance value of resistors based on their color bands.

## Instructions

Resistors have color-coded bands to denote their resistance values. The first two bands represent a numeric value, and each color corresponds to a specific number.

### Color Encoding

The colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

### Task

The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

1. to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
   to list the different band colors
